During the last 3 months, I got the chance to join a team of data scientist as intern here in Oslo. To learn more about the everyday tools and tasks of a Data Scientist, I got to build a predictive app based on data from [BikeShare](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com). The data is public and available [here](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data).

The idea behind this project is to help the people working on the maintenance of similar shared cityBikes system. By forecasting the flow of bikes at every station in realtime, we can predict which station will require "maintenance" first, and soon offer an optimized travel path for the maintenance team to refurnish/remove bikes.

This is just some preliminary result showing the flows of shared bikes in San Francisco Bay Area, and I will soon share more on the exploratory analysis and the webapp I am finishing to build.
