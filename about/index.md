  Proud dad, Data/Computational scientist and Engineer in Electronics.

  I enjoy [technology at its best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-jTRkDGTMg), data big or small and most of all programming... anything!

  Today I want to help liberate and illustrate data on public health, inequalities, cities and countries in order to improve everyone's life, empower people and improve governance.

  I believe in happiness at work and I am looking for mind blowing projects where I can develop/share my skills among great colleagues.

  I love coffee. Get in touch!
