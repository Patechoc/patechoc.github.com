  Proud dad, computational scientist and engineer in electronics, I enjoy programming... anything, data and [technology at its best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-jTRkDGTMg)!

  Today I want to help liberate and illustrate data for cities, countries, public health and inequalities in order to improve everyone's life, empower people and improve governance.
  
  I believe in happiness at work and I am just looking for mind blowing projects where I can develop/share  
  my skills among great colleagues.
  And I love coffee!
  Get in touch!
