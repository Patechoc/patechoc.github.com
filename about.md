  I want to help liberate data on cities, countries, public health and on inequalities to empower people and improve governance.
  Proud dad, computational scientist and engineer in electronics, I enjoy programming... anything!
  I believe in happiness at work and I am just looking for a place where I can improve
  and share my skills among great colleagues, work on mind blowing projects. And I love coffee!
